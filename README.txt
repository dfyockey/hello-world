# hello-world
Hello, world! This is my first GitHub repository!

I used to be a GitHub noob but am not so much now, and I also have some experience using Subversion.

All the activity in this repo is from my playing around with branches &amp; merges, sponsorship links, and releases.

Here's a test of adding an HTML link my Ko-fi page, as discussed at [How to add a Ko-fi button to GitHub](https://help.ko-fi.com/hc/en-us/articles/360021025553-How-to-add-a-Ko-fi-button-to-GitHub)...

<a href='https://ko-fi.com/T6T61X3W6' target='_blank'><img height='36' style='border:0px;height:36px;' src='https://cdn.ko-fi.com/cdn/kofi1.png?v=2' border='0' alt='Buy Me a Coffee at ko-fi.com' /></a>

And a Markdown link to Ko-fi, from the Github Donate Button tool at [Ko-fi Widgets](https://ko-fi.com/manage/widgets)...
